# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Machine Learning Project to predict heart disease risk using clinical data


## Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease using patient clinical data. The objective is to apply machine learning techniques for early risk assessment.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of medical and demographic features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and related health indicators.

## Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model building and comparison
- Model evaluation using performance metrics

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- KNN
- SVM

## Evaluation
Models were evaluated using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
This project received an **A++ grade** for end-to-end implementation and analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare analytics.
